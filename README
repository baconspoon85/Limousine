Limousine is a drop in PCB replacement for Keychron Q9. This layout is intended to support a 30% layout plus right-side numpad.
-Hotswap MX switch sockets
-2u or split backspace
-Right side numpad with 2u or split 0.
-Traditional row stagger or alpha stagger layout options
-Multiple bottom row layout options including 7u, 10u (with 7u stabilizer mounts), 6u, split 2.25u/2.75u, and a solder only split 3u option
-Two EC11 push button encoders positions, both iterchangeable with hotswap MX switches
NOTE: The split 3u spacebar option is included to accomodate layouts with dedicated left hand mods. It requires soldered switches for the spacebar positions and removal of the hotswap socket for the 2.75u right spacebar position.
